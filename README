== DESCRIPTION:

A Ruby script that can be called from procmail that will create Tracker stories


== INSTALLATION:

First you need an email address to forward things to.  tracker@your-domain.com will probably work well.
In the tracker's home directory, create a .procmailrc file that simply pipes all incoming mail to the tracker.rb script.
Mine looks like this:

:0
*
#* ^To:*
|ruby /home/tracker/tracker.rb

To create a story, just send an email to that address.  The subject will become the story title and the body will be the description.

"Plus addressing" is supported to define the story type.  So sending an email to tracker+bug@your-domain.com will create a Bug, while tracker+feature@your-domain.com will create a Feature (default).

The script relies on a Ruby library to interact with Tracker's API.  It's packaged in here for convenience.  

You need to pass your tracker project number and an API key to the client library.  You must define them at the top of the tracker.rb procmail script.
